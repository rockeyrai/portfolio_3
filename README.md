# ðŸŒŒ portfolio_3

### **Description**
This is my third attempt at creating a personal portfolio, and it features an immersive 3D experience with models like a bird, island, fox, and plane. It's also my first project working with 3D modules. I learned the techniques from JavaScript Mastery tutorials.

### **Features**
- ðŸŽµ **Music Button**: A button at the bottom-left corner to play and stop background music.
- ðŸŒŽ **Interactive 3D Island**: Rotate the island model using the mouse or arrow keys (left and right).
- ðŸ¦Š **Animated Fox on Contact Page**: The fox model moves in response to focus events on the contact form.
- ðŸ“§ **Email Functionality**: Messages sent from the contact form are delivered to my email using `@emailjs/browser`.
- ðŸª§ **Interactive Popups**: Popups at certain points invite visitors to explore various sections of the page.
